description: I'm an NLP researcher with a background in machine learning engineering and a BSCS in Computer Science, currently focused on advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, AI agents, and multimodal large language models. My research spans the development of sophisticated retrieval engines, agentic RAG architectures, autonomous AI agents, and LLM evaluation methodologies, with hands-on expertise in model fine-tuning and benchmarking. Having transitioned from ML engineering to research, I bring both practical implementation skills and theoretical curiosity to exploring how next-generation AI systems can be more reliable, contextual, and useful across diverse applications.
